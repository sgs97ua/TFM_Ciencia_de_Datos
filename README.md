Final Master on Data Science Project that combines two models with the objective of Knowledge Graph Generation.

The two models that have been used for accomplish this task are.
* [ReFinED](https://github.com/amazon-science/ReFinED): ReFinED is an entity linking (EL) system which links entity mentions in documents to their corresponding entities in Wikipedia or Wikidata (over 30M entities). The combination of accuracy, speed, and scalability of ReFinED means the system is capable of being deployed to extract entities from web-scale datasets with higher accuracy and an order of magnitude lower cost than existing approaches.
* [RebEL](https://github.com/Babelscape/rebel): A sequence to secuence model based based on BART that performs end-to-end relation extraction for more than 200 different relation types.
